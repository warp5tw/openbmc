### Serial Over Lan
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e8178eef/openbmc/sol-webui.png">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) console redirects the output of the serverâ€™s serial port to a browser window on your workstation.

This is a patch for enabling SOL in [phosphor-webui](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-webui) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

The patch provides the [obmc-console](https://github.com/openbmc/obmc-console) configuration.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary)

**How to use**

1. Prepare a Poleg EVB with up-to-date boot block, Uboot and OpenBMC versions with this SOL patch applied.  Check with Nuvoton support for the most recent versions.

2. Prepare a Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 motherboard and a LPC cable.

    > _The UEFI firmware version in Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 for verification is 2.15.1234._

3. Connect pins of the **JTPM** header on **Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0** to the **J10** header on **Poleg EVB** with the LPC cable:

    * Connect **pin 1-3, 5, 7-8, 10-12, 15-17** of JTPM with corresponding pins of J10, **one on one**.

4. Steps to copy UEFI SOL related drivers to a USB drive.  

    * Format the USB drive in FAT or FAT32.  
    * Download PolegSerialDxe.efi and TerminalDxe.efi from  [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary) and copy them to the USB drive.

5. Power up the Poleg EVB and steps to prepare a working terminal for Poleg:

    * Download and install the USB-to-UART driver from: [http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) according to the host OS in your workstation.  
    * Connect a micro usb cable from your workstation to J2 header of Poleg EVB.  
    * Wait for the FTDI driver to be installed automatically. The COM port number is assigned automatically.  
    * Open a terminal (e.g., Tera Term version 4.87) and set the correct COM port number assigned by the FTDI driver (in previous step).  
    * The COM port should be configured as follows: **115200, 8 bit, 1 stop-bit, no parity, no flow control**.  
    * Press and release the **PWR-ON-RST (SW3)** button to issue a Power-On-reset.  It's expected to see messages output by Poleg on the terminal. Use the following login name/password to login into Poleg.
        * Login name: **root**  
        * Login password: **0penBmc**  

6. Steps to configure Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 UEFI setting for SOL:

    * Do not plug any bootable device into Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    * Power up Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 and boot into UEFI setting.  
    * Navigate to `Super IO Concifugration` in `Advanced` menu option and enter into `Super IO Concifugration`.  
    * Configure serial port 1 to **IO=3E8h; IRQ=5**, and then disable it.  
    * Go back to the main UEFI setting.  
    * Navigate to `Boot` menu option and select `UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell` as Boot Option #1.  

      + Make sure that the rest boot options are set to **Disabled**.  
    * Navigate to `Exit` menu option and select `Save changes and Reset`.  
    * Press `Yes` in the prompt window and it will reboot then.  
    * Wait for Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 to boot into UEFI shell.  
    * Plug the USB drive prepared in step-4 into Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0's usb slot.  
    * Input the following command at UEFI shell prompt, press enter key and it will route to UEFI shell again.  
      ```
      exit  
      ```
    * Check the device mapping table of the USB drive in UEFI shell. It is **fs0:** here for example.  
    * Input the following command at UEFI shell prompt, press enter key and the prompt will show **fs0:\>** from now.  
      ```
      fs0:  
      ```
    * Input the following command at UEFI shell prompt and press the enter key.  
      ```
      load PolegSerialDxe.efi  
      ```

    * Input the following command at UEFI shell prompt, press the enter key and it will route to the UEFI setting. 
      ```
      exit  
      ```

7. Configure the ethernet communication between your workstation and Poleg EVB:

    * Connect an ethernet cable between your workstation and J7 header of Poleg EVB.  
    * Configure your workstation's ip address to 192.168.0.1 and the netmask to 255.255.255.0 as an example here.  
    * Configure Poleg EVB ip address to 192.168.0.2 and the netmask to 255.255.255.0. For example, input the following command in the terminal connected to Poleg EVB on your workstation and press enter key.  
      ```
	  ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
	  ```

8. Run SOL:

    * Please disable the proxy setting for this test if it's configured.
    * Launch a browser in your workstation and navigate to https://192.168.0.2.  
    * Bypass the secure warning and continue to the website.  
    * Enter the BMC Username and Password (defaults: **root/0penBmc**).  
    * You will see the OpenBMC management screen.  
    * Click `Server control` at the left side of the OpenBMC management screen.  
    * A `Serial over LAN console` menu item prompts then and click it.

### Server Power Operations
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/0f20d6b/openbmc/power.png">

Server Power Operations are using to Power on/Warm reboot/Cold reboot/Orderly shutdown/Immediate shutdown remote host PC.

**Source URL**

* [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/recipes-phosphor/chassis](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/recipes-phosphor/chassis)

**How to use**

1. Connect pins of the **PWRON** header on generic motherboard to the **J13** header on Poleg EVB
    * Depending on your motherboard, you need to find **PWRON** header and connect to **pin5-6** of **J13** header on Poleg EVB.

      > _You can check the schematic of Poleg EVB about **J13** that **pin5-6** for **POWER_SW** and **pin3-4** for **RESET_SW**. However, according to `Server power operations` design on WebUI that only use **POWER_SW** pin for `Warm reboot`, `Cold reboot`, `Orderly shutdown` and `Immediate shutdown` function implementation. Thus, we didn't need to use **RESET_SW** pin for those power operations on WebUI._  

2. Configure reaction of power button on generic motherboard's OS
    * When motherboard's OS is running **Linux** and you press **PWRON** header on motherboard, you're prompted with a list of options - this is the **interactive** shutdown. The OS will go **Orderly shutdown** for a while if you didn't select any action from it. If you don't want this interactive shutdown pop up and hope OS go **Orderly shutdown** directly, you can enter below command in terminal before testing:  
      ```
      gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power 'shutdown'  
      ```
    * When motherboard's OS is running **Windows** and you press **PWRON** header on motherboard, the default reaction is **Orderly shutdown**. Thus, you didn't need to configure reaction of power button in Windows. But, if you find the default reaction is not **Orderly shutdown**, please check `Control Panel`->`Power Options`->`System Settings` in Windows OS.  

    * About Watchdog patch

      There is a package **phosphor-watchdog** included in OpenBMC now. The watchdog daemon is started on host's power on, which is used to monitor if host is alive. In normal case, when host starts, it will send IPMI commands to kick watchdog and so everything would work fine. If host fails to start, the watchdog eventually timeout. However, the default watchdog timeout action is **HardReset** which is defined at [Watchdog.interface.yaml](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/xyz/openbmc_project/State/Watchdog.interface.yaml) in **phosphor-dbus-interfaces** that will cause host rebooted after power on.  

      Currently, we just use Poleg EVB with generic motherboard that has some limitations, thus when we use Ubuntu or Windows as host OS, we didn't receive watchdog off IPMI commands sent from OS or BIOS side, so the default watchdog timeout action will be triggered and host will be rebooted after we pressed `Power on` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI, and that is unexpected behavior. However, we've provided a patch to make `Power on` function work normally for demo purpose, if your host will send watchdog off IPMI command normally then you can remove this patch [0001-Set-Watchdog-ExpireAction-as-None.patch](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/recipes-phosphor/dbus/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/0001-Set-Watchdog-ExpireAction-as-None.patch) from [phosphor-dbus-interfaces_%.bbappend](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/recipes-phosphor/dbus/phosphor-dbus-interfaces_%25.bbappend).  

3. Server Power on
    * Press `Power on` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.  

      > _[obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-start%40.target) is the one driving the boot of the system._  

4. Server Power off (Soft)
    * Press `Orderly shutdown` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.  

      > _The soft server power off function is encapsulated in the [obmc-host-shutdown@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-shutdown%40.target) that is soft in that it notifies the host of the power off request and gives it a certain amount of time to shut itself down._  

5. Server Power off (Hard)
    * Press `Immediate shutdown` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.  

      > _The hard server power off is encapsulated in the [obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff%40.target) that will force the stopping of the soft power off service if running, and immediately cut power to the system._  

6. Server Reboot (Warm)
    * Press `Warm reboot` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.  

      > _The warm reboot of the server is encapsulated in the [obmc-host-reboot@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-reboot%40.target) that will utilize the server power off (soft) target [obmc-host-shutdown@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-shutdown%40.target) and then, once that completes, start the host power on target [obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-start%40.target)._  

7. Server Reboot (Cold)
    * Press `Cold reboot` button from `Server control` ->`Server power operations` of WebUI.  

      > _The cold reboot of the server is shutdown server immediately, then restarts it. This target will utilize the Immediate shutdown target [obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-chassis-hard-poweroff%40.target) and then, start the host power on target [obmc-host-start@.target](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-core/systemd/obmc-targets/obmc-host-start%40.target)._

## System

### Time
  * **SNTP**  
    	Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.

    **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
    The modification time of the file **/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock** indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).

    * Enable NTP by **Web-UI** `Server configuration`  
      ->`Date and time settings`
    * Enable NTP by command  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 
    
      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth2** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
    * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC

      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
    * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
    * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
    
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_
    
    * Poleg connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth0** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  
    
      ```
      ifconfig eth0 up
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.15
      ```  
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on Poleg as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```  
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```  
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >Universal time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC

      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >System clock synchronized: yes  
      >systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  

  * **Time settings**  
    **Phosphor-time-manager** provides two objects on D-Bus
      >_/xyz/openbmc_project/time/bmc  
      >
      > >/xyz/openbmc_project/time/host_  

      **BMC time** is used by journal event log record, and **Host time** is used by Host do IPMI Set SEL Time command to sync BMC time from Host mechanism in an era of BMC without any network interface.  
      Currently, we cannot set Host time no matter what we use **busctl**, **REST API** or **ipmitool set time set** command. Due to **phosphor-settingd** this daemon set default TimeOwner is BMC and TimeSyncMethod is NTP. Thus, when TimeOwner is BMC that is not allow to set Host time anyway.

      A summary of which cases the time can be set on BMC or HOST

      Mode      | Owner | Set BMC Time  | Set Host Time
      --------- | ----- | ------------- | -------------------
      NTP       | BMC   | Fail to set   | Not allowed (Default setting)
      NTP       | HOST  | Not allowed   | Not allowed
      NTP       | SPLIT | Fail to set   | OK
      NTP       | BOTH  | Fail to set   | Not allowed
      MANUAL    | BMC   | OK            | Not allowed
      MANUAL    | HOST  | Not allowed   | OK
      MANUAL    | SPLIT | OK            | OK
      MANUAL    | BOTH  | OK            | OK

      If user would like to set Host time that need to set Owner to SPLIT in NTP mode or set Owner to HOST/SPLIT/BOTH in MANUAL mode. However, change Host time will not effect BMC time and journal event log timestamp.

    **Set Time Owner to Split**
    ```
    ### With busctl on BMC
    busctl set-property xyz.openbmc_project.Settings \
       /xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner \
       TimeOwner s xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split
    
    ### With REST API on remote host
    curl -c cjar -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X  PUT  -d \
       '{"data": "xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split" }' \
       https://${BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner/attr/TimeOwner
    ```
    **TimeZone**  
    According OpenBMC current design that only support UTC TimeZone now, we can use below command to get current support TimeZone on Poleg
    ```
    timedatectl list-timezones
    ```

### Sensor
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e1d1733/openbmc/sensor.png">  

[phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon) daemon will periodically check the sensor reading to see if it exceeds lower bound or upper bound . If alarm condition is hit and event generating option is on, it calls [phosphor-logging](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-logging) API to generate a **Log entry**.  
Later on, ipmi tool on host side can send IPMI command to BMC to get SEL events, [phosphor-host-ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid) will convert the **Log entries** to SEL record format and reply to host.

**How to use**

* **Configure sensor and event generator**

  * Add Inventory of Sensors

     **Inventory of Sensors** is a map table that defines all types of SEL event BMC can generate. It is constructed from a yaml file, [recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-inventory-sel/config.yaml](https://github.com/openbmc/meta-phosphor/blob/master/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-inventory-sel/config.yaml)  

     Below is a sample **config.yaml** for Poleg EVB:
       ```
       /xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system:
         sensorID: 0x01
         sensorType: 0x12
         eventReadingType: 0x6F
         offset: 0x02
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp1/critical_high:
         sensorID: 0x02
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x09
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp1/critical_low:
         sensorID: 0x02
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x02
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_high:
         sensorID: 0x03
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x09
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_low:
         sensorID: 0x03
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x02    
       ```
       > _Please refer to  **Sensor and Event Code Tables** in IPMI 2.0 spec for definition of sensorID, sensorType,  eventReadingType, and offset_  
     
     It defines 4 events which could be generated by 2 temperature sensors on Poleg EVB : 

       Name    | SensorID | SensorType  | EventType | Event Description
       ------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------
       temp1   | 2  | Temperature   | Threshold | Upper Critical - going high
	   temp1   | 2  | Temperature   | Threshold | Lower Critical - going low
       temp2   | 3  | Temperature   | Threshold | Upper Critical - going high
	   temp2   | 3  | Temperature   | Threshold | Lower Critical - going low
    
  * Add Sensor Configuration File
  
    Each sensor has a [config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon%25/obmc/hwmon/ahb/apb) that defines the sensor name and its warning or critical thresholds. These files are located under **recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon%/obmc/hwmon/apb/**.  

    Below is config for a LM75 sensor on Poleg EVB. The sensor type is **temperature** and its name is **temp2**. It has warning thresholds for **upper** and **lower** bound. The event generating option is also enabled for **WARNHI** and **WARNLO** threshold that forcing the sensor alarm to be recorded in a D-Bus object.
      ```
      LABEL_temp1=temp2
      WARNLO_temp1=28500
      WARNHI_temp1=31000
      EVENT_temp1=WARNHI,WARNLO
      ```

  * Modify D-Bus Sensor Error Metadata interface  
  
    Modify the file [Threshold.metadata.yaml](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/xyz/openbmc_project/Sensor/Threshold.metadata.yaml) to determine how to format the meta data of event records, like below : 

      ```
      - name: CriticalHigh
         level: ERR
         meta:
           - str: "SENSOR_DATA=%s"
             type: string
         inherits:
           - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Callout.Inventory
      - name: CriticalLow
        level: ERR
        meta:
          - str: "SENSOR_DATA=%s"
            type: string
        inherits:
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Callout.Inventory
      ```
    **xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Callout.Inventory** is inherited here in order to include **CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH** into phosphor-logging Log entry.

* **Dump events**

  * Using WebUI  
  
    In `Event log` page of **WebUI**, the event may contain a related item like below.
    * **CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH** means it has association info in **Inventory of Sensors** table and **/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_high** is the key to this map table.  
    * **SENSOR_DATA** is the sensor reading while the event is recorded.  

      ```
       CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH=/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_high SENSOR_DATA=31000 _PID=2531
      ```

  * Using IPMI
    
    Use IPMI utilities like **ipmitool** to send command for getting SEL records.  
    ```
    $ sudo ipmitool sel list
    
       1 | 10/04/2018 | 07:08:54 | Temperature #0x03 | Lower Critical going low  | Asserted

### FAN
In Poleg, we support four FAN slots and FAN RPMS will dynamic adjustment according temperature variation. However, before using FAN function, you need to provide 12V external power into FLOPPY PWR on Poleg, 12V connect to PIN 4 and GND connect to PIN 2 of FLOPPY PWR.

**Source URL**

Default Web-UI only show one Fan Tach Fan1, and Poleg support four Fan Tach. Thus, we modify this file to support four Fan Tach.

    **How to use**  
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/5745760/openbmc/fan.png">
    * Monitor FAN RPMS by **Web-UI** `Server health`  
      ->`Sensors`
    * Enable FAN dynamic adjustment with temperature variation by command  
      ```
      systemctl start obmc-chassis-poweron@0.target  
      ```
      
      This command will trigger systemd to execute chassis poweron target this unit. Due to FAN control function related to Host control, if you didn't connect to Host with your Poleg EVB, you can use this command to slmulate FAN control function.
    * Test FAN RPMS by command
      ```
      echo 25 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/pwm1
      echo 50 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/pwm2
      echo 100 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/pwm3
      echo 255 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/pwm6
      ```
      We can set pwm value (0-255) for pwm1-3, and 6 to control FAN1-4 RPMS value by echo command and the result will show on Web-UI

## IPMI / DCMI

### SOL IPMI
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e8178eef/openbmc/sol-ipmi.png">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the serverâ€™s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) is used as an example.

This is a patch for enabling SOL via IPMI using [phosphor-net-ipmid
](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

The patch integrates [phosphor-net-ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) into Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution for OpenBMC.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

### Message Bridging

BMC Message Bridging provides a mechanism for routing IPMI Messages between different media.

Please refer to [IPMI Website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/ipmi-home.html) for details about Message Bridging.

  * KCS to IPMB
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/icons/522a8e05/kcs2ipmb.png">

The command "Send Message" is used to routing IPMI messages from KCS to IPMB via System Interface.

Later, the response to the bridged request is received by the BMC and routed into the Receive Message Queue and it is retrieved using a Get Message command.

The patch integrates the [kcsbridge](https://github.com/openbmc/kcsbridge), [ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid) and [ipmbbridge](https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/#/c/openbmc/ipmbbridge/+/11130/) projects.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

## LDAP for User Management
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/b6fdec0d/openbmc/ldap-login-via-ssh.png">

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

LDAP is specified in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Track publications called Request for Comments (RFCs), using the description language ASN.1.

A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords. This allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.

      + Copy all directories and their containing files from [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/dlc/ldap-support-user-management](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/dlc/ldap-support-user-management) under OPENBMCDIR/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750 directory according to their default hierarchy.

    * Update OPENBMCDIR/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/recipes-phosphor/nss-pam-ldapd/files/nslcd.conf. (optional)
      + The IP address for the LDAP server in Ubuntu is configured as **192.168.0.101**. Modify the field **uri ldap** in nslcd.conf according to your network configuration.
        > _uri ldap://192.168.0.101/_
      
    * In the build machine, open a terminal window (build environment is configured in advance and the working directory is at OPENBMCDIR/build) to input the following commands to build the OpenBMC image.
      ```
      bitbake -C fetch libpam
      bitbake -C fetch pamela
      bitbake -C fetch nss-pam-ldapd
      bitbake -C fetch dropbear
      bitbake -C fetch phosphor-rest
      bitbake -C fetch phosphor-webui
      bitbake obmc-phosphor-image
      ```
    * Follow the section **Programming the images** of [Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc) to program the updated image into Poleg.

5. Test LDAP server.

   * Connect Poleg(J12 header) to the PC running Ubuntu with an ethernet cable and power on Poleg.
   * Login into Poleg from the console program (like Tera Term) with the root account (root/0penBmc).
     > _The console program is used to display a debug console provided by Poleg._

   * Set up IP addresses for Poleg and Ubuntu so that they can ping each other.
     + For example, set Poleg's IP address to 192.168.0.2. Input the following command in the console program.
       ```
       ifconfig eth2 192.168.0.2
       ```

       > _Please replace **192.168.0.2** with your IP configuration for Poleg._
   * Execute the following command in the console program.
     ```
     ldapsearch -ZZ -h 192.168.0.101 -D "cn=admin,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com" -b "dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret
     ```  
     > _Please replace **192.168.0.101** with your IP configuration for Ubuntu._  
     > _The ldapsearch example is to display all the data stored in the LDAP server using a TLS connection._
   * You could use the account **user1** stored in the LDAP server to login into WebUI running on Poleg.
     + Use an LDAP tool to modify the field **macAddress** of the DN **bmc-uid=bmc1,ou=bmc,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com** stored in the LDAP server.
       > _The modification is to use the mac address of the ethernet module on the Poleg EVB you currently test with._

     + To get the mac address desired, input the following command in the console program.
       ```
       ifconfig eth0
       ```
       > _Locate the keyword **HWaddr** displayed in the console program._  
       > _Copy the value next to HWaddr to override the value of the field **macAddress** of the DN **bmc-uid=bmc1,ou=bmc,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=com**._

     + Launch a browser and navigate to the Poleg's IP address.
       > _Bypass the secure warning and continue to the website._

     + Use user1/123 to login into WebUI.
       > _user1 is the login ID._  
       > _123 is the login password._

   * Password modification is also available to LDAP accounts via WebUI.
     + Login into WebUI using user1/123 as mentioned in previous phrase.
     + Navigate to `Users` menu item on the left panel and selec it.
     + A sub menu item `Manage user account` pops up and select it.
     + Input the current password value for user1.
       > _The password is set to 123 by default._  
       > _The input location is right below **CURRENT PASSWORD** text area._

     + Input a new password twice.
       > _The input locations are right below **NEW PASSWORD** and **RETYPE NEW PASSWORD** text area._

     + Press the `Save change` button.
       > _A message **Success! User Password has been changed!** is expected to show then._

     + Logout WebUI and login in again with the new password for user1.

    * Login into Poleg via SSH using an LDAP account.
      + Make sure that configurations stated in Step 5 for Poleg and Ubuntu are set accordingly and ping between Ubuntu and Poleg is okay.
      + Install **ssh** in Ubuntu with root privilege if ssh client is not available. Open a terminal and input the following command.
        ```
        sudo apt-get install ssh
        ```

      + Open a terminal in Ubuntu to login into Poleg using the LDAP account **user1** and its password via SSH. Input the following command in the terminal.
        ```
        ssh user1@192.168.0.2
        ```
        > _Please replace **192.168.0.2** with your IP configuration for Poleg._
